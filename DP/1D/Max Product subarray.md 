and 

```java 
public class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
        int res = nums[0];
        int curMin = 1, curMax = 1;

        for (int num : nums) {
            int tmp = curMax * num;
            curMax = Math.max(Math.max(num * curMax, num * curMin), num);
            curMin = Math.min(Math.min(tmp, num * curMin), num);
            res = Math.max(res, curMax);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Understanding (Second Code)

temp variable is very useful as currMax will be updated and we need the value before to update the currMin.

We go to every number multiply with currMin and currMax.

The previous currMin could become the next currMax after being multiplied by a -ve and vice versa. Also it can be that a number is greater than both currMax and currMin because both of them were -ve so we just start from there again.

CurrMax must be the largest product currently possible it's value should increase only and never decrease.

CurrMin is the most negative values we have right now it's value should decrease and never increase.
