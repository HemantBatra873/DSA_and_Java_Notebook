## Arithmetic Progression (AP)

An **Arithmetic Progression** is a sequence in which the **difference between consecutive terms is constant**.

### Notation

* First term: `a`
* Common difference: `d`
* Number of terms: `n`
* Last term: `l`

---

### 1. n-th Term of AP

aₙ = a + (n − 1)d

---

### 2. Sum of First n Terms of AP

Sₙ = n/2 × (2a + (n − 1)d)

Alternative form:

Sₙ = n/2 × (a + l)

---

### 3. Last Term of AP

l = a + (n − 1)d

---

### 4. Number of Terms in AP

n = (l − a) / d + 1

---

### 5. Arithmetic Mean (AM)

For two numbers `a` and `b`:

AM = (a + b) / 2

---

### 6. Special AP Sums

* Sum of first n natural numbers:

1 + 2 + 3 + … + n = n(n + 1) / 2

* Sum of first n even numbers:

2 + 4 + 6 + … + 2n = n(n + 1)

* Sum of first n odd numbers:

1 + 3 + 5 + … + (2n − 1) = n²

---

## Geometric Progression (GP)

A **Geometric Progression** is a sequence in which the **ratio between consecutive terms is constant**.

### Notation

* First term: `a`
* Common ratio: `r`
* Number of terms: `n`

---

### 1. n-th Term of GP

aₙ = a × rⁿ⁻¹

---

### 2. Sum of First n Terms of GP (r ≠ 1)

Sₙ = a × (rⁿ − 1) / (r − 1)

Alternative form (commonly used when |r| < 1):

Sₙ = a × (1 − rⁿ) / (1 − r)

---

### 3. Sum of Infinite GP (|r| < 1)

S∞ = a / (1 − r)

---

### 4. Common Ratio of GP

r = aₙ₊₁ / aₙ

---

### 5. Geometric Mean (GM)

For two numbers `a` and `b`:

GM = √(ab)

---

### 6. Number of Terms in GP

n = log(aₙ / a) / log(r) + 1

(Used rarely, but mathematically valid.)
